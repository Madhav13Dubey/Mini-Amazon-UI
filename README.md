# Mini-Amazon-UI
This project is a frontend clone of the Amazon homepage, built purely with HTML and CSS. It's my first web development project, aimed at practicing layout design, responsive structures, and styling using CSS. The replica includes a navigation bar, banner section, product categories, and footerâ€”closely mimicking Amazon's user interface.
